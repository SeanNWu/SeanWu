        <td>I was involved in a method to predict central 10Â° global and local visual field (VF) measurements using macular optical coherence tomography (OCT) volume scans with deep learning (DL). Our study included 1121 OCT volume scans and 10-2 VFs from 289 eyes (257 patients). We used macular scans to estimate 10-2 VF mean deviation (MD), threshold sensitivity (TS), and total deviation (TD) at 68 locations, and a 3D Convolutional Neural Network based on 3D DenseNet121 architecture was used for prediction. We compared DL predictions to those from broken-stick models (BM) and carried out 10-fold stratified cross-validation to optimize generalizability. The performance of DL and broken-stick models was compared based on correlations between ground truth and predicted VF measures and mean absolute error (MAE: ground truth-minus-predicted values). We found that macular OCT volume scans can be used to predict global central VF parameters with clinically relevant accuracy.</td>
